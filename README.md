<h3>How does my computer at home/office work?</h3>

- First and foremost, your computer needs to be connected to a Local Area Network(LAN) before it could browse on the Internet either via Ethernet or Wireless connection.
- From your LAN or WAN it will go to your Internet Service Provider(ISP). Your ISP is the company that you are paying for internet services.
